# Fields and basic concepts

All the operations in Boojum are happening on the Mersenne31 field - which is natural numbers modulo prime $p$, where $p = 2^{31} - 1$.


Using such fields means that:

* to represent larger numbers, like u32, you have to use 2 separate elements
* for safety we assume that most of the entries in the field are smaller than u16
* for larger operations (where we need u64 etc) - we keep using `Mersenne31Complex` (holding 2 elements) and `Mersenne31Quartic` (holding 4 elements).


## Multiplicative groups in fields - omega

In the documentation and code, you'll see $\omega$ - here's the quick explaination how it works.

Let's use a field with a smaller prime - for example 17, pick a number 3 - and see what happens when we start multiplying 3 by itself within this field:

```
3^1 = 3
3^2 = 9
...
3^16 = 1
3^17 = 3 
```

So in our scenario, 3 is a generator of a multiplicative group of size 16 (this group also happens to contain all the elements of the field except for 0 - but this doesn't always have to be the case).

Now let's look at some cool features:

if 3 is a generator of the group of size 16, then $3^2 = 9$ is a generator of a group of size 8, and $9^2 mod 17 = 13$ is a generator of a group of size 4.

```
13^1 = 13
13^2 = 16
13^3 = 4
13^4 = 1
```

You can also notice that there can be multiple groups of size 4 - we can create a new one, by simply multiplying the generator by the original generator $3$.

```
3*13^1 = 5
3*13^2 = 14
3*13^3 = 12
3*13^4 = 3
```

These are so called "cosets" - and we will be using them when we do Low Degree Extensions in our code.

You can see the things above visualized on images below:

## Why Mersenne field ?

In the previous system, we used Goldilocks field $p = 2^{64} âˆ’ 2^{32} +1$, that had a nice large multiplicative group with a high 2-adicity (so the size of this group was divisible by a large power of 2).

In case of mersenne field, the group that is spread on it, doesn't have this property (it is only divisible by $2^1$).

So instead, we'll do most of the operations on the `MersenneComplex` struct - that is an  extension field (think - complex numbers) - and has a group of size $2^31$. 

If you're curious: this is the generator for this group:

```rust
pub const TWO_ADIC_GENERATOR: Self = Self {
    c0: Mersenne31Field::new(311014874),
    c1: Mersenne31Field::new(1584694829),
};
```
